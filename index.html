    <!-- And make it cheesy ! -->
    <p>A rumor spreads of those plotting to finish their training in XML and JAVA. It has been a month since the trainees were chosen. Little do they know what is in store for them over the next eight weeks.</p>

    <p>The Leaders and Mentors have more projects in mind. These projects are designed to push the trainees to their limits. They are diabolical to the point of almost tourture. However, the skills already posessed by the trainees are up to task.</p>

    <p>Determined to complete their training, the trainees embark on yet another adventure to solidify their role in the Android universe. The final app in just ahead, but the trainees must first complete a few more projects to aquire the skills needed to overcome the final test.</p>

    <p>Wishing everyone luck as we move further into the program. Hope everyone is learning and getting better at the basics. We are only a third of the way down the path to the Nano Degree selection. Keep pluging away and keep up the good work!!</p>

    <p>Feel free to grab files and mess around with the code. Everything has to be in the same folder in order to work the way I have the html coded.</p>
