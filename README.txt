A fun little html/js project that someone from my Udacity Android class found and modified:

You can grab the files from my Google drive:

Or you can get the clean code from a link in the article. If you go this route you will need to pull the code together to get it to work.

Scott replaced the scrolling text with a story about our Android online class.  A great start, but I felt it needed further tweaking and
hacked around in it a bit to replace the Star Wars logo with a Udacity logo.
